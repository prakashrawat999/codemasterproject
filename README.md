Internet usage is rapidly growing, and many applications previously developed for
desktops are now being used on the web with the help of Internet, many
applications can be accessed at any time and from anywhere. It is essential for
developers to have tools for creating their applications, and one of those tools is
called an online code editor.
Online code editors are tools accessible via browsers and located on remote
servers. While some online code editors have basic functions like syntax
highlighting or code completion, others are like complete IDEs. It is often difficult
for developers, whether amateurs or professionals, to use local code editors.
Among developers, online code editors are widely used because they are fast,
efficient, and highly popular but after some time, we miss something on that
platform, which is working in groups on the same platform, even though if we use
Zoom, Google Meet and MS Teams etc. to join a group, the person writing the code
shares the screen to show the code and It is not possible for other group members
to edit or run the code you are writing.
Is there a forum that each of your group can access to discuss and modify code
while engaging in a chat.?
In our website, we have built a feature called Code Master, where up to multiple
group member can work on a shared window and communicate on a chat window
at the same time. On code master, anyone connected to the same room can see,
edit and execute code written in five different languages at the same time and
provides web-based solution for front-end web designers. Additionally, it's a great
way for new developers to catch their mistakes early in an interactive environment
